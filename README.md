## Comments

I would have asked questions about the UI, for instance, if the search input should perform the search after typing, or add a search button, if the theme selection should persist, etc, but I haven't had the time to do it during the week, and I would like to deliver during the weekend, so I had to make assumptions. I hope you understand it.

I have disabled eslint cause I am not used to this set of rules and I don't wan't to spend time on it

I have created the app in the Todos Tab inside the Nav

I have also assumed that the data needs to be fetched from each endpoint and then the search looks into that downloaded data
